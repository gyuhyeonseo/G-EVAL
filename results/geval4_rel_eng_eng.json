Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother ’ s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . ‘ That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , ’ he told the Sunday People . ‘ I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence ‘ They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. ’ Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was ‘ haunted ’ by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time .

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved .

New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages , not moving at all ' . Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop 's owner . Scroll down for video The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina , in Mexico 'There 's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river ( 200m away ) which runs out to the sea and the marina , ' Mr Weston explained . 'The dog went to the water 's edge to see the crocodile ( being curious I guess ) but things did n't go according to plan obviously . 'It was certainly a shock to the system . Guess that 's nature though , ' he said . In the video the beast glides through the water , with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other , as crowds gasp in amazement .

But we did n't want to look at it again as we had just eaten . Yesterday morning there was no sign of either . ' Social media users have reacted in horror to the video that was posted on the Bogged Facebook page . One woman called the video 'horrible ' and another said ' I hate crocodiles now ' . But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries . As well as living in the nearby sanctuary , crocs are regularly spotted on the resort 's golf course . In Mexico the 'American Crocodiles ' can reach lengths of 6 meters and as a result of urbanisation are living closer to humans than ever before . One social media user called the video 'horrible ' and another said ' I hate crocodiles now '",

        "source": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes . Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '",

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '\n\nSummary:\n\nFa chairman greg dyke wants to increase minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 . The proposals also include changing the rules so that ` home-grown ' means having trained in england for three years before the age of 18 .

        "source": "( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .
